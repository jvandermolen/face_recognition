# bytefish/facerecognition_guide #

## description ##

This is my guide to face recognition with OpenCV2 C++ and GNU Octave/MATLAB. If you research on face recognition, you'll soon notice there's a [gigantic number of publications](http://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=face+recognition), but source code is very sparse. So this guide is here to change that. Two algorithms are explained and implemented with GNU Octave/MATLAB and OpenCV2 C++ namely [Eigenfaces](http://www.bytefish.de/blog/eigenfaces) and [Fisherfaces](http://www.bytefish.de/blog/fisherfaces). 

## build the project ##

To build the Python version of this document simply run `make python`, to build the Octave version of this document run `make octave`.

## further reading ##
If you are looking for a complete Python or GNU Octave/MATLAB implementation of various algorithms, please use [github.com/bytefish/facerec](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec) instead.
